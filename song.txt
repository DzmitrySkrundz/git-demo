There is a weight upon me, still;
The quivering stench of the incomplete,
Looming, terrible.
I can barely breathe...
This isn't what I thought this would be...
Toil with me, if you will.
I'm sorry, O', God!
I'm sorry!
I left you there...
O' God, I left you there...
Might this be my atonement, might my sacrifice be done.
I will die here on this Mountain.
I bid thy circle's closing.
I bid Thee end this Pilgrim's Path.
I bid my will be done with blood unto this ink
With which I scribe my final words.
And so it is done.
So mote it be.
So I pray for peace amidst the madness.
Be free, be without pain,
And receive thy Holy Mountain.
